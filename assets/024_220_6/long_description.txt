An empty classroom features light blue walls, a vibrant green floor, and a whiteboard mounted on one wall. On the left, a black speaker is on a stand, and a small amplifier or device is on a stand nearby. A white desk is situated in the center, facing the right side of the room.  In front of the desk, a microphone stand holds a black microphone. To the right of the microphone stand, a line of folding tables is prepared for use.  The room also has windows with blinds that partially obscure the view of the outside. The overall impression is of a classroom ready for educational use.
