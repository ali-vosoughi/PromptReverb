An empty church hall features rows of black chairs facing a wooden altar at the far end. A white curtain hangs behind the altar, flanked by two chairs. A chandelier hangs from the ceiling, and light-colored walls contrast with the darker wood of the altar and curtain elements. A blue carpet or runner is visible on the floor near the front of the seating area, and a small table with a single white flower arrangement is placed beside the altar. A window on the left side allows light to enter the space, and hanging lights with decorative elements are also visible. The overall layout and absence of people contribute to the serene and empty atmosphere of the church hall.
