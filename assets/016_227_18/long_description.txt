A grand theater with a multi-tiered ceiling featuring circular skylights is illuminated by bright spotlights. The ceiling is primarily a light beige or cream color with circular skylights and subtle decorative elements. The walls are a light yellow-beige color and are punctuated by rows of bright red seats that are neatly arranged in rows.  A balcony or upper level visible beyond the front rows of seats overlooks the performance space. The room is framed by burgundy or dark red curtains. The overall impression is one of grandeur and elegance, with the warm light of the stage and the red of the curtains contrasting beautifully against the neutral tones of the theater's interior.
