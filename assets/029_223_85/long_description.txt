An empty subway station features a vaulted, grid-like ceiling covered in a blue and white pattern. Tall, sturdy concrete walls rise from the floor, providing a stark contrast to the colorful ceiling. Metal support beams crisscross the ceiling, and the walls are punctuated by sections of exposed concrete. A portion of a subway entrance is visible in the lower left, and a dark pool of water is in the lower middle of the image. Two individuals can be seen walking towards the back of the station. The scene is illuminated by a combination of natural and artificial light sources.
