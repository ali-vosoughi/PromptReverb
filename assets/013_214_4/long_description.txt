An empty theater features a vibrant red stage curtain, adorned with a gold trim and floral patterns. The stage is elevated and framed by a railing with gold accents. The theater's ornate balconies, painted in gold and red, stretch across the walls and like the ceiling, decorated with green plants and intricate patterns. The plush red seats are neatly arranged in rows on either side of the stage. A gold-colored railing runs along the sides of the stage area. The floor of the theater appears to be a dark red or burgundy color.
