An opulent church interior features a pristine white ceiling adorned with intricate gold designs, a majestic dome, and a checkerboard floor of black and white tiles. Several rows of polished wooden pews are neatly arranged, facing the altar. The altar is draped in a rich gold fabric and topped with a large crucifix. Near the altar stands a statue of a saint, and a gold-colored pulpit or lectern is positioned nearby. A grand staircase with a gold railing leads up to the altar, and above, a balcony overlooks the scene. The walls are embellished with paintings and gold accents, adding to the church's regal appearance. A large, round, gold-colored object is also visible near the center of the image, between the pulpit and the altar.
