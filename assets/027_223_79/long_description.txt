A dimly lit room with a high ceiling features a model of a train track and several railway-related elements. The model is attached to a metal structure, which is supported by a green metal beam. The green metal beam contrasts with the model's grayish-silver color. The room has a pale beige or cream-colored wall. On the left side, a white or light-colored door stands slightly ajar, and there are a few openings that could be windows or train cars. On the right side, a dark-colored sign or banner is visible. A light fixture is visible in the center of the high ceiling, illuminating the room.  A small group of people are visible near the door and on the right side, but their actions are not clearly discernible.
